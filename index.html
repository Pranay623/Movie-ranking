    <h1>The Best Movies According To Pranay</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <li><h3>Hostel Daze</h3></li>
    <p>This is my favourite web-series that teached me how to conquer problems in college life and hostel life.
        It tells me how much a freindship important for a life.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Panchayat</h3></li>
    <p>This web-series is one of my favourite because it tells that a human is always disappointed by others success and does not see his happiness and later on when it becomes our past we regret it because we did not enjoyed that life.</p>
    <li><h3>Kaagaz</h3></li>
    <p>This social based movie is one of my favourites because it speaks on a very common social topic which is fake death certificates that people makes to take land,house and properties of anyone and then the person roams around due to his fake death.</p>
